 # Symptom Tracker MVP - iOS Development Guide

## Project Overview
A **universal symptom tracking iOS app** designed for chronic illness management. This app is **NOT condition-specific** - it's built as a universal platform that can serve any chronic illness community.

**CRITICAL MVP CONSTRAINT:** We are building for **ONLY ONE chronic illness (Peripheral Neuropathy) in the MVP** purely to validate the concept with a single condition before scaling. The app architecture, naming, and design are **completely condition-agnostic** and ready for multi-condition expansion.

## Core Features for MVP
1. Multi-screen onboarding flow (universal for any chronic illness)
2. Homepage with symptom logging sliders (configurable per condition)
3. Food logging functionality (universal)
4. Exercise logging functionality (universal)
5. Rest/sleep logging functionality (universal)
6. **Predictive flare-up analysis** - NO notifications, pure prediction based on yesterday's data

**Key Principle:** This is **Symptom Tracker**, not "Neuropathy Tracker" - all naming reflects universal chronic illness management.

# Complete App Flow & Functionality Summary

## What This App Does (High-Level Overview)

### **Core Purpose**
The app learns your personal chronic illness patterns by analyzing what you did yesterday and correlating it with how you feel today. It then uses today's activities to predict tomorrow's symptom severity and flare risk.

### **Daily User Journey**
1. **Morning:** User opens app, sees prediction for today based on yesterday's logged activities
2. **Reality Check:** User logs actual current symptoms, app learns prediction accuracy  
3. **Activity Logging:** Throughout day, user logs food, exercise, and sleep in under 2 minutes per entry
4. **Intelligence Building:** App analyzes today's complete data to predict tomorrow's flare risk
5. **Next Morning:** Cycle repeats with new prediction, algorithm gets smarter over time

### **No Notifications - Pure Prediction**
- App does NOT send any notifications or alerts
- All intelligence displayed on homepage as risk indicators
- User opens app to see predictions, app doesn't push information

### **Universal Design with Single Condition MVP**
- Built for ANY chronic illness (arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia, etc.)
- MVP hardcoded for Peripheral Neuropathy to prove concept
- All architecture ready for immediate multi-condition expansion
- Zero condition-specific naming in codebase or UI

   - Learns user's personal response patterns
   - Builds accuracy score for predictions

2. **Today ‚Üí Tomorrow Prediction:**
   - Analyzes today's logged food, exercise, sleep
   - Calculates tomorrow's flare risk using learned patterns
   - Updates homepage prediction for next day

3. **Pattern Learning:**
   - Week 1: Establishes baseline (60% accuracy)
   - Week 2-4: Identifies personal triggers (75% accuracy)
   - Month 2+: Highly personalized predictions (85%+ accuracy)

### **Risk Factors (Universal Chronic Illness Principles):**
1. **Sleep Impact (35%):** Poor sleep universally increases next-day symptoms
2. **Exercise Recovery (30%):** Overexertion requires recovery time
3. **Food Triggers (25%):** Inflammatory foods cause delayed symptom response
4. **Cumulative Stress (10%):** Multiple poor choices compound risk

### **No Notifications - Only Homepage Display:**
- All predictions shown when user opens app
- No push notifications, alerts, or interruptions
- User controls when they see information

## Homepage Updates After Logging

### **Real-Time Prediction Updates:**
- **Tomorrow's Risk Indicator:**
  - Green: "Tomorrow looks manageable based on today's choices"
  - Yellow: "Tomorrow may be challenging - consider today's activities"
  - Red: "High flare risk tomorrow - today's combination concerning"

### **Today's Progress:**
- Visual indicators: ‚úì Food logged | ‚úì Exercise logged | ‚úì Rest logged
- Missing items show as empty circles

### **Contextual Insights:**
- "Your pain is higher today - poor sleep last night likely contributed"
- "Energy good today - yesterday's rest day helped"
- "Symptoms match prediction - algorithm learning your patterns"

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### **Common Scenarios:**
- **Incomplete logging:** Saves partial data, allows completion later
- **Missed days:** Shows "Need more data for accurate predictions"
- **Invalid data:** Friendly validation with clear error messages
- **App crashes:** Auto-save protects data, resume where left off
- **Insufficient history:** "Building your pattern - predictions improve with data"

## Complete Daily Cycle

### **Perfect Usage Pattern:**
1. **Morning:** See yesterday-based prediction, log actual symptoms
2. **Throughout Day:** Log food after meals (2 minutes each)
3. **After Exercise:** Log workout details (1-2 minutes)
4. **Evening:** Log sleep from previous night (2 minutes)
5. **Background:** App calculates tomorrow's prediction
6. **Next Morning:** Cycle repeats with improved accuracy

### **App's Core Promise:**
*"Track your symptoms and activities in under 6 minutes total per day. We'll learn your personal chronic illness patterns and predict tomorrow's flare risk with increasing accuracy."*

### **Key Principles:**
- **Yesterday Predicts Today:** Validates algorithm accuracy
- **Today Predicts Tomorrow:** Uses current data for next-day forecasting
- **Universal Design:** Works for any chronic illness, not just one condition
- **No Interruptions:** Pure prediction, no notifications
- **Personal Learning:** Algorithm adapts to individual patterns

## Predictive Analysis Algorithm

### Universal Risk Prediction Model

#### Core Concept: Yesterday ‚Üí Today ‚Üí Tomorrow
- **Yesterday's Data + Today's Symptoms = Algorithm Learning**
- **Today's Data + Learned Patterns = Tomorrow's Prediction**
- **No Notifications - Pure Predictive Intelligence**

#### Risk Factors (Universal Chronic Illness Framework)
1. **Sleep Quality Impact (35% weight):**
   - < 5 hours sleep ‚Üí 60% increased next-day symptom risk
   - Poor sleep quality ‚Üí Compounds all other risk factors
   - Recovery sleep ‚Üí Reduces accumulated sleep debt

2. **Exercise Recovery Patterns (30% weight):**
   - High intensity + inadequate recovery = High next-day risk
   - Consistent moderate exercise = Protective factor
   - Sedentary periods = Gradual symptom increase risk

3. **Food Trigger Response (25% weight):**
   - Individual trigger foods ‚Üí 12-24 hour delayed response
   - Large meals + poor sleep = Compounded risk
   - Anti-inflammatory foods = Protective patterns

4. **Cumulative Stress Load (10% weight):**
   - Multiple poor choices exponentially increase risk
   - Single risk factor = Manageable
   - Personal stress tolerance learned over time

### Prediction Accuracy Learning
```
Week 1: Baseline establishment (50-60% accuracy)
Week 2-4: Pattern recognition (70-80% accuracy)  
Month 2+: Personalized model (85%+ accuracy)

Learning Process:
- Compare yesterday's prediction to today's reality
- Adjust algorithm weights based on accuracy
- Identify personal trigger combinations
- Refine timing of symptom responses
```

### Risk Communication (No Notifications)
- **Green (0-30):** "Low risk - patterns look good"
- **Yellow (31-65):** "Moderate risk - some concerning factors"
- **Red (66-100):** "High risk - multiple factors suggest caution"
